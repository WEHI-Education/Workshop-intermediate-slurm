## Example Files

<!--
FIXME: place any data you want learners to use in `episodes/data` and then use
       a relative link ( [data zip file](data/lesson-data.zip) ) to provide a
       link to it, replacing the example.com link.
-->
Download the [demo programs zip](data/example-programs.zip) and unzip it on Milton. 
If you have VAST Scratch, unzip it there. Your home directory is ok too.
